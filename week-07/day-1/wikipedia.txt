History
The original school building, made of brick, opened in 1928. A wooden building was later built next to the brick one. The original brick building was renovated and renamed the "Gray Building" in 1958, and that year the current main building opened. The school crest was designed in the 1970s.[1]

At first Belle Chasse High was K–12, but in 1977 Belle Chasse Middle School opened to take the middle grades away.[2]

In 2009–2010, the school had 882 students, and this increased to 890 by 2010–2011.[3]
